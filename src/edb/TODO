- check that our keys and ciphertexts are actually random and changing..

- marshalling/escaping code is too complicated and sometimes wrong; e.g.,
  text seems to encrypt a quoted version of the string.

- use PBKDF2 for password-based key generation.
  need to store (salt varchar(128), rounds int) for each external principal,
  and fetch it before being able to compute the key.

- RND wrapper around SWP for completeness.

- fix MySQL UDFs so that invalid invocations do not crash the server,
  e.g. "select searchSWP();"
