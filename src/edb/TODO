- getCStr leaks memory without reason: c_str() is already null-terminated.
  unfortunately, some callers are assuming they get a private copy..

- check that our keys and ciphertexts are actually random and changing..

- marshalling/escaping code is too complicated and sometimes wrong; e.g.,
  text seems to encrypt a quoted version of the string.
