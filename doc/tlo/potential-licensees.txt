The potential licensees include a variety of database vendor companies
such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, HP, most of which have one or more
relevant products that can use the technology. Other licensees include
cloud providers such as Amazon or Microsoft (SQL-Azure) or Rackspace,
or private cloud technology providers such as Eucalyptus and their
competitors.

Last but not least, there is a strong startup possibility to take
CryptDB to market.  Given the number of database security, privacy,
and confidentiality leaks in recent months, and the fact that they
seem to be growing, the market is likely quite large.
