}

the authors are trying to execute Sql queries over encrypted data.
This paper does not use homomorphic encryption.

Instead, it splits the domain of possible values for each column in
partitions. A server tries to do as much of the query as possible, but
the result at the end is filtered by the client for correctness. The
more partitions, the more useful work the server does (the least
remains for the client); however, the less security clients have.

Each partition has a number (random or order-preserving) and each
value is replaced with the ident of the partition. The actual tuple is
stored encrypted.

We can see that selections and joins are partially solved on the server side.

Aggregation needs to be all computed on the client (eg. sum, max).
This is infeasible.

Grouping can partially be done by the server.

In the case of certain selections or joins, the number of tuples is quite large.

}

This paper attempts to perform sql aggregation queries on encrypted
data. The encryption scheme they use is homomorphic and is from
Rivest's paper on Data Banks and Privacy Homomorphisms, written in
1978. This encryption is not secure according to our standards today.
If the server knows on value - ciphertext mapping (which is very
likely because the encrypted values must be the values over which we
want to compute functions or there must be a mapping between the two
-- not clear how to come up with a secure one) , he will find out the
secret key (which is p and q the factors of the public value n).

This paper tries to delegate computation to untrusted workers in a way
that the workers do not gain any information about what they are
computing, what the data is and one can also verify it.
It uses Gentry's fully homomorphic encryption as input to Yao's
garbled circuit. The cost to verify a result is much less than to
compute the result; however, the client must perform some initial
computation that is linear in the size of the circuit of the function
to be computed, but once only.

This paper tries to compute queries on encrypted data. Each element in
a tuple is encrypted and hashed to a few number of buckets such that
there are collisions which are used to help with privacy. Range
queries can be computed using a B+ tree but these are done by the
trusted client who needs to traverse the B+ tree by performing queries

Attempt to allow SQL over encrypted data. Data is encrypted field by
field with some deterministic encryption.
Only support interger operations, so far only support equality, all
fields are at the DET level and thus leak even when they only need be at
sem level. A wide range of operations not supported. Has client side
processing.
Does not seem to be changing the design of the DBMS and also uses
user-defined functions.
Does not support the join. The agent -- in our case the client-side
performs this.
Seems to be sending data for decryption at the server and hoping the
server discards it after no use -- if adversary listens then, it hears
the data
They use difference preserving encryption that leaks so much -- not
secure by any standard!
the encryption function used is f(x) = ax+b..knowledge about one field's
value leaks the whole column
