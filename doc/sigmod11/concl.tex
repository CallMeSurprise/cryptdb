\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:concl}

This paper presented CryptDB, a practical and novel system for ensuring
data privacy on an untrusted SQL DBMS server.  CryptDB uses three novel
ideas to achieve its goal: an {\em SQL-aware encryption strategy},
{\em adjustable query-based encryption}, and {\em onion encryption}.  As part of
CryptDB's SQL-aware encryption strategy, we propose optimizations for
existing cryptographic techniques, as well as a new cryptographic
mechanism for private joins.  Our prototype of CryptDB requires no
changes to application or DBMS server code, and uses user-defined
functions to perform cryptographic operations inside an existing
DBMS engine, including both Postgres and MySQL\@.  Under a TPC-C
workload, our prototype incurs a $\tput$ reduction in throughput
compared to an unencrypted DBMS, making CryptDB a practical
option for privacy-sensitive data.
