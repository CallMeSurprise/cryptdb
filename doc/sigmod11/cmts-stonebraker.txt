You should probably make it clear up front that CryptDB is aimed at
transaction processing, and such systems have a predefined workload,
that is static. Hence, biggest restrictions in your model are not
so problematic.

Right now you mention restrictions as they come up throughout the text;
it would be better (in my opinion) to say what they are up front,
and then explain why restrictions are not so bad.

I was not aware of any practical order preserving crypt-function.
Your discussion does not increase my confidence.  You might also
explain what it actually does.  Also, it is a serious disadvantage
that you coan't do multiplication -- i.e. 10% raise won't work.

Also, no computation and comparison in the same command is problematic.

I am not sure how practical it is to dynamically alter the
crypto-level.  If you have the transactions in advance, you can compute
what level each column will run at.  Also you can decide what joins
have to be allowed and "do the right thing"
