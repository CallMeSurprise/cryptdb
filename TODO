* Make sure that constant expressions in queries (e.g., SELECT "mysecret";)
  are encrypted with RND, even if it's some temporary key that does not
  correspond to any column.

* Update cur_db in Rewriter::rewrite() when it changes due to a USE command,
  and set it initially when receiving a connection via mysql-proxy and
  CryptDB.connect().
